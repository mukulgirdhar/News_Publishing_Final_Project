An AI could guess what videos people were watching purely from their brainwaves.  Grigory Rashkov at Russian research firm Neurobotics and his colleagues trained an AI using video clips of different objects and brainwave recordings of people watching them.

Published by THR, the interview sees Batman actor Bale recount his memory of the “committed” performance from Ledger – who would have turned 40 today – revealing that the actor wanted to be hit for real in one of the 2008 film’s key moments: the interrogation scene.  The interview, conducted by Joseph McCabe in 2008, is featured in the new book 100 Things Batman Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die.  Bale remembered: “As you see in the movie, Batman starts beating the Joker and realises that this is not your ordinary foe. Because the more I beat him the more he enjoys it. The more I’m giving him satisfaction.  “Heath was behaving in a very similar fashion. He was kinda egging me on. I was saying, ‘You know what, I really don’t need to actually hit you. It’s going to look just as good if I don’t.’ And he’s going, ‘Go on. Go on. Go on.’', N'2019-11-30 16:34:29')
