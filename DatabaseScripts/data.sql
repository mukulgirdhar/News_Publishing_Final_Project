Published by THR, the interview sees Batman actor Bale recount his memory of the “committed” performance from Ledger – who would have turned 40 today – revealing that the actor wanted to be hit for real in one of the 2008 film’s key moments: the interrogation scene.  The interview, conducted by Joseph McCabe in 2008, is featured in the new book 100 Things Batman Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die.  Bale remembered: “As you see in the movie, Batman starts beating the Joker and realises that this is not your ordinary foe. Because the more I beat him the more he enjoys it. The more I’m giving him satisfaction.  “Heath was behaving in a very similar fashion. He was kinda egging me on. I was saying, ‘You know what, I really don’t need to actually hit you. It’s going to look just as good if I don’t.’ And he’s going, ‘Go on. Go on. Go on.’', N'2020-08-25 16:34:29')

Tesla’s designers gave the truck an unconventional design, which has allowed some to imagine different versions of the truck.
